## Applying to Jobs

* Apply to as many open developer positions as possible ideally 15-20 a day.
* When applying to developer positions be sure to include as many areas that are desirable for you to live in/you will be willing to interview in.
* Your goal should be to apply to 150-300 jobs in 2-3 months.
* Don't worry if they are looking for someone with more experience in the requirements, a lot of time HR gets that wrong and most companies are willing to take someone with less experience if they feel like they can do the job and learn fast.
* Make sure to have your TrueCoders resume downloaded as a PDF, if you don't have that DM Cody and ask for it.
* Use websites like Indeed.com or ZipRecruiter or Monster.com.
* Use your TrueCoders resume summary as your cover letter if you don't have one.

## After You Apply for the Job

* With every job application you send you need to have a personal connection established with someone in the company. Follow these steps for doing that:
* Look up on Linkedin someone that is in management from that company in the department your applying for then add them on Linkedin.
* Then put together a personal email to that person explaining that you just submitted an application for whatever the position was that you applied for. Kadarius put together a great email so you can use that as an example.

For months I've followed your posts and see your passion for Command Alkon and Birmingham. I recently applied for your Software Development full-time position and believe I would be a great addition to the great teams you are building at Command Alkon. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make this happen!

You need to express passion for what you do and why you want to work there, respect for the person your emailing and how eager you are to interview with their company.

* For most small companies or C-level executives, the email format is usually firstName@dreamCompany.com. For larger companies, it may be `firstName.lastName@dreamCompany.com`. But search your email to see if you have ever emailed someone from that company before or email me and I will find out how their email naming works. I also may have their email already so please email me for help.
* Before every interview or phone interview make sure to contact me so we can set up a time for you to meet with one of your instructors for interview prep.
* You need to keep track of every company you have applied to in a Google or Excel spreadsheet, I recommend you copy a version of what I have put together below for yourself.
