We're excited to have you as part of our course!

## Pre Class

In order to facilitate a smooth onboarding process, please follow these steps before you arrive at class on the first day.

### Google Classroom

We use Google Classroom for general task and course assignment management. You will be sent an invite to join a Google Classroom specific to your course.

### Aptitude Test and Student Survey

Even if you're already enrolled, we require all our students to take our aptitude test. We also have a survey for our students to take pre-class. You'll find these assignments waiting for you in Google Classroom.

Please complete these assingments by their due dates.

### Accounts

During this course, you'll be using a few different online tools. Let's get some accounts setup:

* Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com).
* Create a [Codewars Account](https://www.codewars.com)
* Set your Codewars Clan to (cAsE-sEnSiTiVe): `TrueCoders`.
* Accept our invitation to our [Slack Account](https://truecodersio.slack.com/)
* Create a [freeCodeCamp Account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

### freeCodeCamp

Our focus is on object oriented programming languages, like C# and Java. However, having some front end development knowledge can be key to rounding out your knowledge base.

Please complete as much of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Front End Development Certification, at least completing:

* HTML5 and CSS Section
* Responsive Design with Bootstrap Section

### Lightweight Code Editor

There are times where you will want to edit code without all the features of an IDE like Visual Studio.

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but there are other options like [Atom](https://atom.io).

### Source Control

During this course, you'll learn more about Source Control Management. For now, let's just install it so we have it for later.

* Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com) Source Control Management.
* Download [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), a Git GUI for Mac and Windows.
